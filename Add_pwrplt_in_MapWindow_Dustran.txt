Protocol for adding powerplants to Mapwindow with Dustran extension

As a test, added the WH Zimmer plant (Moscow, Cincinnati, Ohio) into Dustran

Information needed for Dustran simulation:

1. Wind speed, m/s
2. wind direction, degrees
3. mixing height, m
4. ambient temperature, C
5. relative humidity, %
6. ambient pressure, mb
7. atmospheric stability, A - F

1. Height of release, m, column FK
2. stack gas exit velocity, m/s, column FQ
3. stack gas exit temperature, C, column FM/FN
4. stack diameter, m, back calc from column FL??
5. building cross section, m^2, column FL
6. initial horizontal plum size, m
